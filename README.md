# Real-World Use-Case for this Project
Allowance for Children per day/week/month to be able to spend a certain amount of funds.

Employers give employees an allowance for their travel expenses.

Businesses give contractors an allowance to spend a certain budget.

# Development-GoalÂ¶
Have an on-chain wallet smart contract.

This wallet contract can store funds and let users withdraw again.

You can also give "allowance" to other, specific user-addresses.

Restrict the functions to specific user-roles (owner, user)

Re-Use existing smart contracts which are already audited to the greatest extent
